# Cost and usage

To Help combat spam vendor signups, a small, reasonable ZANO cost has been implemented to sign up a basic BaZaar Vendor. There are 3 Vendor tiers: 'basic', 'enhanced' and 'featured' with varying degrees of functionality.

## Tier: Featured

The Featured Tier will provide full current and future functionality

## Tier: Enhanced

The Enhanced tier will provide elevated functionality from the basic account

## Tier: Basic
