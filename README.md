# Zano BaZaar - The Decentralized Marketplace

Zano BaZaar is built on Zano and utilizes Zano's Marketplace API, there is little to no centralization on BaZaar and all offers are contained on the Zano Blockchain itself.

**NOTE: This document is a work in progress and will be ontinually updated as features are added and battle tested in the wild!**

# Cost and usage

To Help combat spam vendor signups, a small, reasonable ZANO cost has been implemented to sign up a basic BaZaar Vendor. There are 3 Vendor tiers: 'basic', 'enhanced' and 'featured' with varying degrees of functionality.

Be aware, this document is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as features are added and has been tested more in the wild!

## Tier: "Enhanced - 50 $ZANO

The Enhanced tier will provide elevated functionality from the basic account, some features include:

- Display vendors twitter, discord, telegram and github links and email contact

## Tier: "Basic"" - 20 $ZANO

## Congratulations, your BaZaar is set up!

Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, your BaZaar will be visibile and youll be able to log in.

**NOTE: if you didnt set up a featured BaZaar, you'll have to keep an eye on the [Blockchain Explorer](https://explorer.zano.org) to check whether the Blockchain has confirmed your transaction, otherwise you'll see the BaZaar appear on the front page 'Featured Vendors' section.**

# Logging in

In order to login you will need the hash of the transaction you sent when setting up your BaZaar, and your secret that you generated and sent within the comments, these act as a username and password if you will.

## Getting the Transaction hash

Simply fire up your wallet, and click on the transaction to the BaZaar and copy (click) the hash. Your hash is secured by the blockchain, completely private and visible to nobody (besides the sender and receiver)
